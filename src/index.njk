<h2>The Vegan Arguments Guide</h2>
<p>Thinking of going vegan, but not sure if it’s all just a fad? Are you already vegan, but have a hard time
	replying to your non-vegan friends and family? Do you eat meat and believe veganism doesn’t make sense? Say no
	more, and continue reading.</p>
<p>Many people have compiled similar lists to this one, so I’d like to credit George Martin’s <a

		You can&#039;t be 100% vegan</h4>
	<p>First, let's take a look at the most popular definition of veganism:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—<strong>as far as is possible and
				practicable</strong>—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any
			other purpose.”</p>
		<p>— <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism" target="_blank"
				rel="noreferrer noopener">The Vegan Society</a></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Nobody can be or is expected to be a perfect vegan. That is unless we grew our own
		food, were capable of avoiding any unintentional killing of insects, and could account for every way in
		which
		we could cause animal suffering. But does this mean we shouldn’t be 99%
		vegan? In other words, does this mean we shouldn't try our best to avoid
		harm to animals? Absolutely not.</p>
	<p>In reality, the meat, dairy, egg, wool, fur, and leather
		industries alone account for most of all animal abuse. In our
		modern world, it is impossible to exist without coming into contact with
		some kind of animal-derived ingredient or product. So the fastest and most
		practical way to end animal abuse is by refusing to support the main
		creators and producers of animal abuse.</p>
	<p>The primary reason we find animal by-products in such a wide range of every day products is due to the
		scale of industries based on exploiting animals. These industries produce so
		much waste (ligaments, bones, brains, intestines, etc), that it makes
		economic sense to use it elsewhere. Decreasing the production of animal
		products, by avoiding the main industries, would make the use of these
		waste products impractical and unprofitable.</p>
	<p>Nobody is expected to be perfect, but ultimately veganism is about doing the best you can and causing as
		little harm towards animals as possible.</p>

	<p>Scientists have demonstrated that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/110/51/20617" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">humans are not at the top of the food chain</a> (also covered by <a

			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientific Scribbles</a>). The National Academy of Sciences of
		the United States concluded that:</p>
	<blockquote> “humans are similar to anchovy or pigs and cannot be considered apex predators”.</blockquote>
	<p>What's more, by arguing that we humans are part of the “circle of life” or “the food chain” you should be
		accepting of possibly being violently killed and eaten by other animals higher in the food chain, such as
		lions or bears.</p>
	<p>While we certainly do not have the carnivore's teeth, claws or physical power to take down and eat an
		animal like a cow or deer with our own bare hands, it may well be argued that our species has developed the
		brain power to create tools that do this for us. In the past this has been true, humans relied on our
		intelligence to develop tools that facilitated efficient hunting and killing. But does that mean we should
		continue to fall back on such primitive excuses in the twenty-first century? No.</p>
	<p>We are undoubtedly the most <a href="arguments/humans-are-superior-to-animals/">intelligent species</a> on
		this planet, rather than compare ourselves to instinct driven animals that know nothing else, we should push
		our species forward by embracing this superior intelligence and ending all forms of animal exploitation.</p>

		Eating animals is necessary</h4>
	<p>Eating animals is not necessary. There are millions of vegans across the globe and from all paths of life
		that lead perfectly healthy lives. In fact, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>, the United States’ <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">largest organisation of food and nutrition professionals</a>, states the
		following:</p>
	<blockquote>“It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and
		Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including <strong>vegan, diets
			are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits
			for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.</strong> These diets are
		appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy,
		lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood and for
		athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than
		diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources
		and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and
		vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including
		ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of
		cancer, and obesity.”</blockquote>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">largest study ever on vegan nutrient profiles</a> found:</p>
	<blockquote>“In strict vegetarians, low dietary intakes of vitamin B12
		and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to iron and zinc,
		have often been of concern <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R25" target="_blank"
				rel="noreferrer noopener">25</a></sup>. In the present study, mean intakes of these
		nutrients were above minimum requirements <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R26"
				target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">26</a></sup> in strict vegetarians.”</blockquote>
	<p>In a modern environment where one is not living in a state of survival there is quite simply <a
			href="https://viva.org.uk/animals/number-animals-killed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no
			need to exploit and slaughter billions of sentient beings</a>. All necessary nutrients can be found in a

		Eating animals is natural</h4>
	<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s natural, because this doesn’t imply eating meat is ethical or good. This is known
		as an “<a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeal
			to nature fallacy</a>”. We don’t do things solely because they’re
		natural. We use
		planes, cars, buildings, clothing, cutlery, cups, glasses, and an array
		of things that are not natural. There are other natural things we avoid,
		such as killing members of our own species and forcibly impregnating
		females, because nature is a violent place. Some diseases and health
		problems are natural, but we do whatever we can to get cured.</p>
	<p>Our civilisation is largely focused on reducing suffering
		rather than in staying aligned with nature. In many cases, we strive to
		avoid the dangers of nature. We should do what’s ethical, not what’s
		natural. Killing animals when we don’t need to is unethical, period.</p>

		Humans are omnivores</h4>
	<p>This is still debated in the scientific community. There’s a
		substantial amount of evidence pointing towards us being herbivores, or
		at least scavengers (like rats, who eat meat after the animal’s been
		killed by other predators). This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312295/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">article by William C. Roberts, MD</a> argues that humans must be
		plant eaters
		because only herbivores develop atherosclerosis (hardening of the
		arteries). Technically though, we’re omnivores by definition just
		because we can digest meat. But this is irrelevant because we can be
		completely healthy as vegans, and eating meat causes harm to animals.</p>
	<p>Having the ability to do something doesn’t mean it’s right to
		do so. Human beings can carry out many atrocities, and some do, but
		those that do face punishment because their actions are wrong. Having
		canine teeth or the ability to digest meat doesn’t justify eating
		animals in the same way having a fist doesn’t justify beating someone
		up.</p>

		Farmers treat their animals like family</h4>
	<p>No doubt many farmers feel some form of attachment to the sentient beings they raise and care for, these
		people would have to be especially callous to feel nothing at all—though <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWfZCiWsNU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it does
			happen</a>. However, this is not the same kind of love or care that any normal person would feel towards
		their family members.</p>
	<p>Famers care for their animals like one may care for a car, a computer or any other valuable business asset.
		Farmed animals exist to serve a business, once they no longer serve their purpose they are sold, slaughtered
		or disposed of. <br /></p>
	<p>Male dairy cows are slaughtered hours after birth or sold for export and <a

			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slaughtered for veal</a>. Male chicks produced for the egg
		industry are separated at birth and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9jV-SW5bo" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">suffocated to death</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udSiluTAOaQ"

			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO6Wd1i7eoM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent to

			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr5oyFSrZ9I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-stun
			slaughterhouses</a>. Pigs are suffocated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajWrCfqlbo8" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">gas chambers</a> before having their throats cut, while little
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoZ1_ZcpeLI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pigglets

		Eating meat helped us evolve</h4>
	<p>It doesn’t matter if it did, because we live in a very different
		world and different things today will make us evolve other than eating
		meat. Also, that something helped us evolve doesn’t mean that such
		behaviour is ethical or acceptable today. Early homo sapiens used rape
		as a strategy for gene-promotion when they could not get access to
		consensual sex. This helped the human species evolve to where we are
		today, we cannot then say that sexual violence is in any way acceptable.</p>
	<p>In addition, most scientists agree that <em>it wasn’t meat</em>, but <a
			href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking foods, that made our brains evolve</a>.
		This would explain why we’re the smartest animals and the only animals
		that cook, while other more carnivorous animals like cats are less
		intelligent than us. The hypothesis is that cooking allowed humans to
		get more energy from the same volume of food, and to spend less time
		chewing, which meant this extra energy helped fuel brain growth.</p>

		Eating meat is healthy</h4>
	<p>We can be completely healthy eating a non-vegan diet, as long as we <a

			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limit our intake of meats</a> with high saturated fat and
		cholesterol and eat enough fruits and vegetables to get essential micronutrients. Many meat eaters live long

		otherwise, it merely states that given the choice of being healthy as a vegan or a non-vegan, we should
		choose the former since it is the ethical choice.</p>

		Farmed animals are bred to be killed</h4>
	<p>Bringing an animal into existence for the purpose of abusing, using
		and harming them is not ethical under any circumstance. If we breed dogs
		for dogfighting, the harm inflicted on the dogs by the fight is still
		not morally acceptable. If we breed bulls for bullfighting, the
		suffering inflicted on them is never justified.</p>
	<p>The animals that are being used and killed do not care about

		If the world went vegan, farm animals would go extinct</h4>
	<p>This argument is dishonest and assumes that a life of captivity, mutilation and selective breeding for the
		purpose of exploitation and slaughter is beneficial to the animal, that we are doing them a favour by
		forcing their existence.</p>
	<p>Not wanting farmed animals to go extinct is a selfish concern, not a concern for the animals which are
		<em>never</em> brought into this world to enjoy it, to live a natural life as nature intended. Farmed
		animals are selectively bred and modified by humans to
		be profitable. They suffer all kinds of health problems because they are
		bred to be much bigger, faster growing or high-yielding compared to their natural ancestors.
	</p>
	<p>It is true that they may go extinct, continuing to
		breed farm animals serves no logical purpose when there is no demand for their exploitation. Is this a bad
		thing?</p>
	<p>The world we have created since the dawn of animal agriculture is not one of nature, it may have served us
		well in the past when the human population was low and animal agriculture relatively small. But we now live
		in a world of eight billion people with consumption demands that far outstrip what animal agriculture or the
		planet can provide.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Humans and livestock now make up almost <strong>96%</strong> of all mammal biomass on earth. All other
			mammals account for just <strong>4%</strong>.</p>

				Phillips and Milo, 2018</a></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>But total extinction is not a realistic future. If we really wanted to keep the pigs, chickens, cows and
		other animals we eat alive, we can conserve them in the same way endangered
		species are, by <strong>not</strong> by killing them. Many animal sanctuaries exist today where farmed
		animals are rescued and
		enjoy the rest of their lives, there is no need for species to go extinct.</p>

	<h3>tl;dr</h3>
	<p>If the world went vegan; industries that produce animals <em>purely for our consumption</em> would move on
		to other business. The wild ancestors of farmed animals would continue to exist as they do today, a smaller
		number of farm animals found in sanctuaries would most likely continue to exist.</p>

	<p>The animals we eat, wear and experiment on have been artificially bred to meet the demand for animal
		products. If the demand decreases, the number of animals brought into existence will decrease too. There was
		no problem with overpopulation of cows, chickens and pigs before humans started messing with their bodies.
		If we stop breeding them out of control, they wouldn’t overpopulate.</p>

		Animals don’t understand morality</h4>
	<p>Most animals do have at least a basic understanding of right and

	<p>Regardless, animals aren’t morally valuable because of their

		Humans are superior to animals</h4>
	<p>In some ways, yes we are superior in many aspects.</p>
	<blockquote>I don't hold animals superior or even equal to humans. The whole case for behaving decently to
		animals rests on the fact that we are the superior species. We are the species uniquely capable of
		imagination, rationality and moral choice – and that is precisely why we are under the obligation to
		recognise and respect the rights of animals.<br /><br />— Brigid Brophy</blockquote>
	<p>However, we’re not superior
		in our ability to fly or see in the dark, to exist under water or to navigate naturally by magnetic fields.
		It could be argued that some
		humans are superior to other humans in certain areas. Some humans are
		smarter, faster, stronger, better looking and so on. By this logic, the
		“superior” humans could in theory abuse the “inferior” ones.</p>
	<p>Superiority doesn’t grant us a right to abuse other sentient
		beings. In fact, this line of thinking is what justified many atrocities
		in the past, like The Holocaust, black segregation, disenfranchisement
		of women, and so on. Of course, nobody wants animals to have the same
		rights as humans, like the right to vote, because this doesn’t make
		sense. What does make sense, however, is to grant them the right to life
		because their sentience means they have an interest to live, just like
		us.</p>

		The animals are already dead</h4>
	<p>Yes. But veganism is not about saving the dead animals in the supermarket, it is about reducing the demand
		for animal products to prevent further animals from being bred and killed. This is the basic Supply and
		Demand theory from economics. If we demand more animal products, the businesses that produce them will
		supply more, therefore killing more animals. We have the power to vote with our money, and every time we pay
		for an animal product we’re indicating we want more of it.</p>

		I eat every part of the animal so they don’t go to waste</h4>
	<p>Animals don’t care what we do with their bodies after their death, they care about staying alive. If we’ve
		already committed the unethical, unnecessary action of killing an animal, what we do after doesn’t make it
		any better. By this logic, American cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer should have received a shorter sentence, because
		he used nearly every part of his victims’ bodies. He ate various parts of them and even turned some body
		parts into household items.</p>

	<p>No religion mandates eating. We don’t have to eat animals to be a devout Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu,
		etc. Therefore,
		we can be vegan <strong>and</strong> religious, just like we can recycle
		and be religious, or just like any other modern lifestyle choice we
		make which is not explicitly mentioned in religious texts but is also
		not prohibited.</p>
	<p>Plus, why would a wise and omniscient God give pain receptors
		to animals and then tell us to kill them? Surely God would approve of us
		being vegan, therefore causing the least amount of harm possible to
		animals and the environment, both of which are God’s creations.</p>

		The dairy industry doesn’t harm animals</h4>
	<p>Cows in the dairy industry, arguably, live more miserable lives than
		cows raised for meat. This is because they are exploited throughout
		their lives for their milk and then killed.</p>
	<p>Given that cows produce milk <strong>only when they’re pregnant</strong>,
		the process begins with forced artificial insemination of cows. Farmers
		insert their arms into the sexual orifice of cows and pump bull semen
		into them. This is a necessary step for milk production and occurs in
		small family farms all the way to factory farms.</p>
	<p>Once the cow gives birth, two things may happen. If the baby is
		male, he’s of no use for the farmers since he’ll never produce milk.
		Therefore, the baby is either <a

			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed at the farm</a>,
		or <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/what-is-veal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold to the
			veal industry</a> for meat. If the baby is female, then
		she’ll endure the same future as her mother, going through several
		cycles of emotional and physical abuse. In both cases, the calves get
		taken away soon after birth, and mother cows tend to cry for days after
		their baby is stolen.</p>
	<p>After about two or three milking cycles, the cow’s milk
		production rate becomes unprofitable, so the cow is killed. At this
		stage, the cow is usually six years old. The natural lifespan of a cow
		is around twenty years.</p>
	<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Dairy cows are forcibly impregnated and give birth for us to have milk.</li>
		<li>Male calves are killed or sold for other uses—such as veal consumption—so we have milk.</li>
		<li>Dairy cows are killed when their milk production no longer meets profitable requirements.</li>

		The egg industry doesn’t harm animals</h4>
	<p>In the egg industry, only females are required since males cannot lay
		eggs. So at the hatcheries, male and female chicks are separated as
		they pass through a conveyor belt.</p>
	<p>Males are considered useless so they are either killed at the
		hatchery (either by being macerated alive, drowned or suffocated) or
		thrown into the bin alive. Females are painfully de-beaked and sent off
		to farms, where they will lay a painful 300+ eggs per year due to
		genetic manipulation (as opposed to a wild chicken’s 20 or so per year).
		This process happens on any farm, regardless of it being free-range,
		organic or whatever.</p>
	<p>After hens stop producing eggs at a profitable rate, they are
		sent to slaughter, which involves being thrown into an electric bath to
		be stunned, then hoisted up upside down and going along a conveyor belt
		to have their throats slit. Many chickens will remain fully conscious
		after their throats are slit and will be boiled alive in the
		de-feathering tank afterwards. Their slaughter happens at around two
		years of age. The natural lifespan of a chicken is eight years.</p>

		People would lose their jobs if the world went vegan</h4>
	<p>Yes, this is a sad reality. But as consumers, we aren’t responsible
		for keeping all industries in business. When we go to the supermarket,
		we don’t buy every single product they sell to make sure nobody goes out
		of business. As consumers, we choose where our money goes and pay for
		the products we want to see more of, and we don’t buy those we dislike.
		We all understand this, which is why when someone quits smoking or
		drinking alcohol, people don’t tell them they’re putting people in the
		tobacco and alcohol industries out of jobs.</p>
	<p>However, it is important to realise that jobs aren’t lost, only
		displaced. If we’re not buying milk we’d be buying soy milk instead,
		therefore creating jobs in the plant-based milk industry. While it is
		true that dairy farmers will have a tough time, for example, it is also
		true that there is a growing demand for other crops like rice, soy and
		oats which is putting more people into jobs in those industries, which
		is only for the best.</p>

		It’s legal to eat animal products, there are laws to protect animals</h4>
	<p>Just because something is legal doesn’t make it right. Less than 200 years ago, slavery was legal in the
		United States.</p>
	<p>The laws in place to “protect” farmed animals still allow
		significant harm to be inflicted to them. Organisations like the Royal
		Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) claim to work to prevent
		unnecessary harm to animals. But since we know that <a href="arguments/eating-animals-is-necessary/">eating
			animal products is unnecessary</a>, isn’t <strong>all</strong> the harm caused in the meat, dairy and egg
		industries unnecessary?</p>
	<p>This is an excerpt of what the <a href="https://www.hsa.org.uk/methods/external-trauma" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">Humane Slaughter Association</a> deems a “humane” way to kill an animal:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>“Infant lambs, kids and piglets can be humanely killed by
			delivering a heavy blow to the head. This must only be used if no other
			method is immediately available.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Hold the animal by the back legs and deliver a firm blow
				to the back of the head with a blunt instrument, e.g. an iron bar or
				hammer.</li>
			<li>Hold the animal by the back legs and swing it through an
				arc to hit the back of its head with considerable force against a solid
				object, e.g. a brick wall or metal stanchion.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>With both methods, it is essential that the blow is
			delivered swiftly, firmly and with absolute determination. If there is
			any doubt that the animal has not been killed effectively, the blow
			should be immediately repeated.”</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This clearly shows there’s is nothing humane about the way we
		treat and kill animals. Under UK law, chickens can still be debeaked,
		male calves can be castrated, pigs can have their teeth pulled out, and
		more. Needless to say, the best way to stop most animal abuse from
		happening is to end animal agriculture altogether.</p>

		You buy products from sweatshops</h4>
	<p>Trying to invalidate veganism by saying vegans still cause harm by
		buying from sweatshops is a form of the “al tu quoque” fallacy. The
		truth of a statement or philosophy not determined by the individuals who
		believe in it. If a murderer says it’s wrong to commit murder, that
		doesn’t make murdering people right. If a vegan says it’s wrong to kill
		animals for food, but causes some harm elsewhere, that doesn’t make
		killing animals right. It is impossible to cause zero harm, and no vegan
		claims perfection, but we’re trying to reduce our impact as far as
		practicable and possible.</p>
	<p>Plus, buying animal products is not helping workers in unfair
		conditions. Being vegan and buying from sweatshops is better than not
		being vegan and <em>still</em> buying from sweatshops. But what if we
		saw the argument the other way round? In other words, that the logical

		Animals eat other animals</h4>
	<p>We should not base our ethics as a society on what animals do in
		nature. Lions eat their offsprings if they don’t have enough food,
		engage in violent territorial disputes and forcibly impregnate females.
		Dogs smell each others’ backside when they first meet. Many animals even
		kill <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/do-animals-murder-their-own-species" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">members of their own species</a>.
		If we say that animal behaviour is a basis for human morality, we could
		advocate murder, infanticide, rape and several other unethical and/or
		disgusting behaviour that are commonplace in nature.</p>
	<p>Another crucial point is that animals in the wild kill to
		survive. We don’t need to eat other animals to survive, and doing so
		causes suffering, so if we can avoid it, we should. Animals are clearly
		not good ethical role models.</p>

		Going vegan doesn’t make a difference</h4>
	<p>Veganism is both a matter of principle and a practical solution to animal abuse. If we’re against paying
		others to torture and kill animals, then we shouldn’t do it, regardless of whether we will actually change
		something. However, being vegan also has real effects because of supply and demand. If someone buys vegan
		alternatives to meat products, every day, three times a day, for a year, they would’ve reduced the thousands
		of millions of vegans in the world, this represents a serious drop in demand. The UK has seen a <a

		indicators also show veganism is on the rise. If we want a large number of vegans to have an impact in the
		world, then we need to begin by becoming part of the group.</p>

		The whole world will never go vegan</h4>
	<p>It is very hard for the whole world to do anything. The world will always have some sexism, racism,
		homophobia and violence. That doesn’t mean we must tolerate these things when we see them and that we
		mustn’t fight to eradicate violence. Even though there will always be people that abuse animals, we should
		still try to end animal abuse as much as possible. The existence of people in the world doing something
		unethical is no reason for us to copy them. We have control over our decisions and we can choose to be
		ethical regardless of what others do.</p>

	<p>In all farms, regardless of how the lives of animals are before slaughter, animals die at a fraction of
		their lifespan. Farmed animals get killed as soon as their purpose is served, or as soon as they reach a
		profitable size. The definition of grass-fed, organic and free-range animals is very loose and can vary
		wildly. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the animals have any quality of life, it just means the farm has to
		meet some arbitrary requirements to earn that title.</p>

		Animals are humanely slaughtered</h4>
	<p>We can, in theory (and not at the large scale required to feed 8 billion humans), kill an animal without
		any pain. However, this does not make the act of killing morally acceptable. Killing animals, thus depriving
		them of their right to life, for selfish desires like your appetite, is wrong.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/humane" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">definition of the word “humane”</a> is:</p>
	<blockquote>“Having or showing compassion or benevolence”.</blockquote>
	<p>Synonyms include “compassionate”, “kind” and “considerate”. Therefore, “humane” and “shooting animals”, are
		not compatible.</p>
	<p>No truly compassionate person capable of empathy would want to take the lives away from animals for
		something as trivial as a sandwich filling.</p>

		Animal products are tasty</h4>
	<p>Animal products are a result of the suffering and killing of animals. If we can justify eating animals and
		their secretions by merely saying that we like the taste, this implies we believe that unethical actions can
		be justified by the personal pleasure we derive from them. This is clearly problematic. Using this line of
		thinking, we could justify stealing, for example, because it feels good to have more money. Harming another
		sentient being for our own pleasure is immoral.</p>

		Vegan food is tasteless</h4>
	<p>Most of the food humans eat is already vegan. Fruits, vegetables,
		grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta, bread, potatoes and soy, to name a
		few things. We enjoy these foods every day and don’t think they’re
		unpalatable. In fact, the main way we condiment our food to make it
		delicious is by using salt, sugar, herbs and spices (all plants!). There
		are award winning vegan food products and restaurants all over the
		world. We can easily find online recipes to veganise all of our
		favourite meals.</p>
	<p>But even if vegan food <em>was</em> tasteless (<a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=incredible+vegan+food" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not</a>), morality trumps personal pleasure. <em>An animal’s desire to live
			will always be greater than our desire to eat a steak, and deep down we all know this.</em></p>

		Vegans are judgmental</h4>
	<p>Of course, <em>some</em> vegans are. There are all kinds of people in every movement, and veganism isn’t an
		exception. But the personality of adherents to a movement doesn’t determine the validity of the ideology
		behind it. For example, if someone against racism is a bad person, that doesn’t mean we can justify racism
		because some non-racist people are mean. If we don’t like judgmental vegans, becoming a vegan and being the
		counter-example is the best we can do.</p>

		Morality is subjective</h4>
	<p>Advocates of subjective morality wouldn’t tolerate such subjectivity if <em>they</em>
		were the victims. If someone kills a human, or an animal, and truly
		believes there’s nothing wrong with this, subjective morality states
		that this wouldn’t be unethical. Morality must be based on facts and
		reason, it can’t be completely arbitrary, or else anyone can justify any
		atrocity by stating that their morality is subjective. We must have at
		least some objective measurement of what is and isn’t ethical. Agreeing
		that killing beings for pleasure or convenience isn’t ethical is a good
		place to start to prevent violence towards humans and animals. Veganism
		follows from this.</p>
	<p>Even if we believe morality is subjective, it’s likely that <em>most people would agree</em> that animals
		have some moral value and shouldn’t be harmed for no reason. So by this <em>subjective</em>
		morality, we can agree that veganism is right because harming animals
		unnecessarily (we don’t need to eat them to live healthily) is wrong.</p>

		Not everyone can be vegan</h4>
	<p>There are certain, extremely rare circumstances where people cannot
		be vegan due to uncommon medical conditions or living conditions. But
		vegans argue that everyone that can be vegan, should. If someone can’t
		there is nothing that can be done about it. Veganism is about <em>doing what
			is practicable and possible</em> to end animal exploitation. Most people
		reading this have access to a computer, which probably means they can
		decide to stop paying industries that harm animals right now.</p>

	<h4 id="human-rights-are-more-important">
		Human rights are more important</h4>
	<p>Veganism is a non-action. We don’t need to actively do anything time
		consuming to live vegan. Once you spend some time initially figuring out
		what to buy at the grocery store and what’s suitable for vegans, most
		people won’t spend additional time thinking about food than they did
		before. As such, we can continue to fight for human rights or other
		“more important” causes while eating a veggie burger or bean burrito
		instead of a steak. We don’t need to harm animals while we fight against
		human oppression.</p>
	<p>It is also worth putting the animal suffering problem into perspective. Worldwide, <a
			href="https://www.animalequality.net/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 billion land
			animals</a> are killed every year for food. Animal agriculture is the <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/"
			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading cause of
			species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon
			deforestation</a>.
		Nowhere in the world are humans being exploited in the magnitude and
		severity as non-human animals are. If they were, there would be global
		unrest and the issue would be addressed immediately.</p>
	<p>Also, in many cases, animal abuse can cause human suffering.
		High meat and dairy diets are responsible for some of the United States’
		leading killers, like heart disease and strokes. In areas where new
		slaughterhouses are set up, the <a href="http://animalstudies.msu.edu/Slaughterhouses_and_Increased_Crime_Rates.pdf"
			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rates of domestic violence and crime increase</a>.
		Many human rights violations occur in factory farms because of the high
		production rate required to meet the demand for meat. For example, <a
			href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/No_Relief_Embargo.pdf" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">some US factory farm workers wear diapers to work due to a lack of bathroom
			breaks</a>.</p>
	<p>Shouldn’t we think the animal rights issue is at least as
		important as some human rights issues? And even if not, shouldn’t we be
		vegan by default to avoid causing extra suffering while we focus on
		solving human rights violations?</p>

		Plants feel pain</h4>
	<p>Let’s think about this in two ways. First, do plants <em>actually</em> feel pain in any way similar to an
		animal or human? Most honest people would agree that there is a <strong>huge</strong> difference between
		cutting a leaf from a tree and killing a dog. In fact, a human’s experience of suffering is <em>closer</em>
		to the animal’s experience of suffering than the animal’s experience of suffering is to any potential
		“suffering” in plants.</p>
	<p>This common sense experience is backed by scientific evidence,
		too. We know for a fact that plants lack brains, a Central Nervous
		System, and anything else that neuroscientists know to cause sentience.
		Some studies show plants to have input/output reactions to certain
		stimulation, but no study suggests plants have sentience or any ability
		to feel emotions or pain as we understand it. We can clearly understand
		the difference between a blade of grass and a pig.</p>
	<blockquote>Non-sentient biological life reacts to stimuli, but does not have subjective experiences or a
		conscious will of its own, and can not be harmed in the same way as sentient life.<br /><br />— <em>Charles
			Horn</em>, Meat Logic</blockquote>
	<p>Second, let’s say we discovered that plants actually have
		something akin to what we understand as “sentience”. In this case, the
		crucial difference is that <em>we need to eat plants to survive, but we don’t have to eat animals</em>.
		Furthermore, more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5522483/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">plants are used for meat production than for vegetable production</a> because
		the animals we eat <em>are fed plants,</em> and they can eat <strong>way</strong> <strong>more</strong>
		than us. So if we truly care about plants, it is better to minimise
		plant usage by feeding humans directly with them, rather than feeding
		many more plants to animals to then eat ourselves.</p>

		Animals die in crops harvested for vegan food</h4>
	<p>This is true, accidental deaths in crop harvesting are a fact of our current existence, <a
			href="arguments/you-cant-be-100-vegan/">no vegan claims to be perfect</a>. Vegans
		try to avoid animal harm through practical solutions such as not supporting industries that exploit animals,
		avoiding direct harm, making ethical choices where possible, etc.</p>
	<p>However, an argument <em>against veganism</em> that uses this claim is in fact an argument several times
		stronger <em>in favour of veganism</em>.</p>
	<p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost eight
			billion people</a> the consumption demands require by our global
		population is increased several times over by the need to feed <a
			href="https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">70 billion farmed animals</a>
		per year than if we were focused on feeding only our own species.</p>
	<blockquote>A vegan lifestyle rejects the exploitation and cruelty found in the meat, <a
			href="arguments/the-dairy-industry-doesnt-harm-animals/">dairy</a> and <a
			href="arguments/the-egg-industry-doesnt-harm-animals/">egg industries</a> and reduces the consumption
		demands required to feed ourselves.</blockquote>
	<p>Some people may argue in favour of exclusively eating grass-fed animals
		who do not require grain, soy or other mass produced feed, therefore not killing small animals in crop
		harvests. Not only is this impractical and unsustainable on a large scale, it is inherently
		<em>elitist</em><em>.</em> There simply is not enough space available in the world to feed billions of
		people on grass fed animals.

		You take medication that has been tested on animals</h4>
	<p>The definition of veganism is: <em>“Veganism is a way of living which
			seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of
			exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other
			purpose”</em>.</p>
	<p>It is not practicable and possible to die or get ill because we
		don’t take medication we need. It is the law in the US, the UK and
		Europe that all medicine must be tested on animals before being released
		to the market, so vegans cannot practically avoid this since there
		aren’t any non-tested medicines.</p>
	<p>But this is a different situation to eating animal products for
		pleasure and convenience when there are plenty of other options
		available at the supermarket. We’re not putting our health at risk when
		deciding to avoid animal products. Also, it is worth mentioning that
		buying the medicine is not actually increasing demand for animal testing
		since the medicine was tested before entering the market and never
		again, whereas animal products require animal deaths every time.</p>

	<p>Historians are still unsure about this, and there is compelling
		evidence to suggest he wasn’t a vegetarian. But it is actually
		irrelevant if he was. Using this argument implies that everything that
		Hitler did was wrong and we must do the opposite. But this isn’t a sound
		argument. Hitler liked dogs, took showers, brushed his teeth, ate and
		slept. Should we avoid doing these things because he did? Of course not!</p>
	<p>In addition, why should we solely focus on Hitler when talking
		about veganism? If we look at all dictators, murderers, serial killers,
		rapists, and terrorists throughout history, the vast majority are
		meat-eaters. So if we’re going with the argument that the diets of
		criminals should be avoided, why are we eating meat?</p>

		Veganism is expensive</h4>
	<p>Veganism <em>can be</em> expensive, but it is by no means a
		necessity. As with any eating pattern, a vegan diet can be as expensive
		or as cheap as we want it to be. Generally, however, a plant-based diet
		is substantially cheaper than most diets out there, given that the
		staple foods in a vegan diet (and coincidentally also staples in
		impoverished societies) are things like rice, beans, lentils, potatoes,
		bread, tofu and so forth. For most of the world, meat is a luxury,
		expensive item. It’s only cheap in developed countries because the
		government subsidises the industry.</p>

		Veganism is unsustainable</h4>
	<p>Quite the opposite, actually. Eating meat is highly unsustainable. The <a
			href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nations</a>
		has been urging us for years to move towards a plant-based diet because
		“lesser consumption of animal products is necessary to save the world
		from the worst impacts of climate change”. This is because <a
			href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">animal
			agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions, about
			18%, than all the transport systems combined in the world, around 13%</a>. It is also the leading cause of
		species extinction, ocean dead zones and several other environmental degradation indicators.</p>
	<p>In fact, we could feed more people with less land, water and resource usage if everyone was vegan than if
		people ate meat. A <a
			href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat"
			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornell University article</a>
		states that the US alone could feed about 800 million more people “if
		all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were
		consumed directly by people”.</p>

		Vegans don&#039;t get enough protein</h4>
	<p>Protein is an incredibly bio-available nutrient. We can get all the
		protein we want from plant sources without the potential health risks of
		eating meat, dairy and eggs (some forms of cancer, diabetes, high blood
		pressure, coronary heart disease, strokes, etc). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/"
			target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest study ever done</a> on vegan nutrient profiles show vegans on
		average
		get <strong>almost the same amount of protein</strong> as non-vegans without supplementation (<a
			href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/figure/F1/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">see Figure 1</a>).
		This is because all whole plant foods contain some protein and when we
		eat enough calories of a variety of these we can easily meet all our
		protein needs. Protein deficiency is only really seen in people with
		chronic under-eating. Even then, it is more likely that someone dies of
		fat deficiency than protein deficiency in a state of starvation.</p>
	<p>If we were to eat 2000 calories of pure white rice, for instance, we’d get <a
			href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/4766327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">41
			grams of protein</a>.
		This is already the recommended daily intake for sedentary women that
		eat 2000 calories per day. And rice is considered to be a low protein
		food, so if we add vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta and tofu,
		we’re going to get more than enough. Even in the extremely rare case
		that someone wants to get an amount of protein that is not achievable
		eating solely plants (which is probably not healthy anyway), plenty of
		affordable vegan protein powders are available worldwide.</p>

		Vegans lack calcium</h4>
	<p>Calcium is in no way exclusive to animal products. There are entire
		cultures who’ve never consumed cow’s milk that don’t have a higher
		incidence of osteoporosis than the developed world. Producing cow’s milk
		required humans to learn how to domesticate animals, which was achieved
		relatively recently in human history. So it is illogical to think that
		humans evolved to require nutrition from a fluid that they could not get
		in nature until centuries later.</p>
	<p>Humans are mammals. Like all mammals, we consume milk during
		infancy, and after the weaning process, adults do not require their
		mother’s milk. If we really needed milk afterwards, wouldn’t it make
		more biological sense to continue drinking milk designed for our own
		species? If that sounds strange, consider that we’re drinking milk from
		someone else’s mother, and not even from our own species.</p>
	<p>Good vegan sources of calcium include dried herbs, sesame
		seeds, figs, tofu, almonds, flax seeds, Brazil nuts and kale. Most vegan
		milks are fortified with calcium, so we could just consume those as we
		would do any cow milk.</p>

		Vegan diet lacks iron</h4>
	<p>Vegans and vegetarians don’t actually have a greater incidence of
		anaemia than meat-eaters. Read this quote from a study done by the <a
			href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/59/5/1233S/4732590" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a>:</p>
	<blockquote>“An appropriately planned well-balanced vegetarian diet is
		compatible with an adequate iron status. Although the iron stores of
		vegetarians may be reduced, the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in
		vegetarians is not significantly different from that in omnivores.”</blockquote>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">largest study ever completed</a> on vegan nutrient profiles states the
		following:</p>
	<blockquote>“In strict vegetarians low dietary intakes of vitamin B12
		and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to iron and zinc,
		have often been of concern <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R25" target="_blank"
				rel="noreferrer noopener">25</a></sup>. In the present study, mean intakes of these
		nutrients were above minimum requirements <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R26"
				target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">26</a></sup> in strict vegetarians.”</blockquote>
	<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/table/T3/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">table 3</a>
		of the same study, we can see vegans get 31.6mg of iron per day, and
		meat-eaters get 32.9mg, both way above the minimum daily requirement of
		8-15mg.</p>
	<p>Good sources of plant-based iron are nuts, beans and dark leafy
		green vegetables. The type of iron found in meat (heme-iron) is the
		type your body cannot regulate properly and forces its way into the
		bloodstream. This encourages the production of <a
			href="https://pharm.org/nutrition/a-double-edged-iron-sword-can-shorten-life-promote-alzheimers/" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">free radicals, which can damage DNA and increase cancer
			risk</a>. So it is safer as humans that we consume plant-based sources of iron (non-heme iron).</p>

		B12 is only found in meat</h4>
	<p>It is a common misconception that animals produce B12. In reality, it
		is bacteria found in animals, excrement, unwashed vegetables and dirty
		water that produces it. B12 is not exclusive to animal products.</p>
	<p>Having said this, in today’s world vegans <strong>must</strong>
		supplement B12 with an oral supplement or by eating fortified foods,
		but this doesn’t invalidate veganism. Stating that because we can’t get
		B12 naturally from plants implies a vegan diet is bad is a version of
		the logical fallacy called “<a href="arguments/eating-animals-is-natural/">appeal to nature</a>“.
		Not only is it a fallacious argument, but most people that live in
		modern society supplement their diets in one way or another.</p>
	<p>Most of the bread, milk, morning cereals and fruit juices we
		buy are fortified with vitamins during manufacturing. Table salt often
		has iodine added, and tap water is fortified with fluoride in some
		places. All these things are fortified because the vast majority of
		people fail to get adequate nutrition without them. Even more
		interesting, a B12 supplement is <a
			href="http://eerainuh.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/vitamin_b12_deficiency.pdf" target="_blank"
			rel="noreferrer noopener">injected into livestock</a> before slaughter to keep their levels up due to the
		soil being too intensively used and lacking in certain nutrients.</p>
	<p>So the question becomes: would we rather take a B12 supplement
		and be vegan, or supplement animals with B12, and then kill them to
		obtain the same B12? The former choice is clearly more desirable.</p>

		I need to eat fish for Omega-3</h4>
	<p>We can get omega-3 fatty acids from ground flaxseeds, hemp seeds, canola oil, walnuts, algae and other
		plant-based sources. If someone can’t get enough omega-3 or their body can’t absorb it, an algae-based DHA
		supplement will solve this. Eating plant sources of omega-3 is actually superior to eating fish to get DHA.
		This is because fish is riddled with heavy metals such as mercury and PCBs, which damage the brain and
		counteract the positive effects of eating the omega-3 in fish.</p>
	<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study by
			Zeilmaker et al</a> looked at 33 fish species and its impact on brain development concluded that “for most
		fish species the adverse effect of MeHg on the IQ score exceeded the beneficial effect of DHA.” Read more

		Vegans lack vitamin D</h4>
	<p>Our body produces vitamin D, a hormone, when exposed to sunlight. We need about 20 minutes of sunlight
		exposure per day to get our daily amount of vitamin D. Most people don’t get this, which is why the UK
		government recommends that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-36846894">everyone takes a vitamin D
			supplement</a>. This is because “limited amounts of the vitamin are found in foods such as oily fish, eggs
		and fortified cereals”.</p>
