<p>It is a common misconception that animals produce B12. In reality, it
  is bacteria found in animals, excrement, unwashed vegetables and dirty
  water that produces it. B12 is not exclusive to animal products.</p>
<p>Having said this, in today’s world vegans <strong>must</strong>
  supplement B12 with an oral supplement or by eating fortified foods,
  but this doesn’t invalidate veganism. Stating that because we can’t get
  B12 naturally from plants implies a vegan diet is bad is a version of
  the logical fallacy called “<a href="../eating-animals-is-natural/">appeal to nature</a>“.
  Not only is it a fallacious argument, but most people that live in
  modern society supplement their diets in one way or another.</p>
<p>Most of the bread, milk, morning cereals and fruit juices we
  buy are fortified with vitamins during manufacturing. Table salt often
  has iodine added, and tap water is fortified with fluoride in some
  places. All these things are fortified because the vast majority of
  people fail to get adequate nutrition without them. Even more
  interesting, a B12 supplement is <a

    rel="noreferrer noopener">injected into livestock</a> before slaughter to keep their levels up due to the soil being
  too intensively used and lacking in certain nutrients.</p>
<p>So the question becomes: would we rather take a B12 supplement
  and be vegan, or supplement animals with B12, and then kill them to
  obtain the same B12? The former choice is clearly more desirable.</p>
