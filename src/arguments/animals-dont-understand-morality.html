title: "Animals don’t understand morality"
---

<h2>Animals don’t understand morality</h2><p>Most animals do have at least a basic understanding of right and
wrong because this is an evolutionary advantage. Altruism often results
in something positive in return, and bad actions usually result in
negativity. If a dog doesn’t kill other dogs, they’re less likely to be
killed by other dogs.</p><p>Regardless, animals aren’t morally valuable because of their
ability to understand morality, they’re valuable because of their
sentience (ability to experience pain and pleasure). Some humans, like
babies, sometimes cannot discern right from wrong, but they still have a
right to life because they’re sentient.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
