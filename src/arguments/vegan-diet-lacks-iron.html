<p>Vegans and vegetarians don’t actually have a greater incidence of
anaemia than meat-eaters. Read this quote from a study done by the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/59/5/1233S/4732590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a>:</p><blockquote>“An appropriately planned well-balanced vegetarian diet is
compatible with an adequate iron status. Although the iron stores of
vegetarians may be reduced, the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in
vegetarians is not significantly different from that in omnivores.”</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest study ever completed</a> on vegan nutrient profiles states the following:</p><blockquote>“In strict vegetarians low dietary intakes of vitamin B12
and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to iron and zinc,
have often been of concern <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25</a></sup>. In the present study, mean intakes of these nutrients were above minimum requirements <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">26</a></sup> in strict vegetarians.”</blockquote><p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/table/T3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">table 3</a>
of the same study, we can see vegans get 31.6mg of iron per day, and
meat-eaters get 32.9mg, both way above the minimum daily requirement of
8-15mg.</p><p>Good sources of plant-based iron are nuts, beans and dark leafy
green vegetables. The type of iron found in meat (heme-iron) is the
type your body cannot regulate properly and forces its way into the
bloodstream. This encourages the production of <a href="https://pharm.org/nutrition/a-double-edged-iron-sword-can-shorten-life-promote-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free radicals, which can damage DNA and increase cancer risk</a>. So it is safer as humans that we consume plant-based sources of iron (non-heme iron).</p>
