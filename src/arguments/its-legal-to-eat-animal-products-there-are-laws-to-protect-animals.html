<p>Just because something is legal doesn’t make it right. Less than 200 years ago, slavery was legal in the United States.</p><p>The laws in place to “protect” farmed animals still allow
significant harm to be inflicted to them. Organisations like the Royal
Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) claim to work to prevent
unnecessary harm to animals. But since we know that <a href="../eating-animals-is-necessary/">eating animal products is unnecessary</a>, isn’t <strong>all</strong> the harm caused in the meat, dairy and egg industries unnecessary?</p><p>This is an excerpt of what the <a href="https://www.hsa.org.uk/methods/external-trauma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humane Slaughter Association</a> deems a “humane” way to kill an animal:</p><blockquote><p>Infant lambs, kids and piglets can be humanely killed by
delivering a heavy blow to the head. This must only be used if no other
method is immediately available.</p><ol><li>Hold the animal by the back legs and deliver a firm blow
to the back of the head with a blunt instrument, e.g. an iron bar or
hammer.</li><li>Hold the animal by the back legs and swing it through an
arc to hit the back of its head with considerable force against a solid
object, e.g. a brick wall or metal stanchion.</li></ol><p>With both methods, it is essential that the blow is
delivered swiftly, firmly and with absolute determination. If there is
any doubt that the animal has not been killed effectively, the blow
should be immediately repeated.</p></blockquote><p>This clearly shows there’s is nothing humane about the way we
treat and kill animals. Under UK law, chickens can still be debeaked,
male calves can be castrated, pigs can have their teeth pulled out, and
more. Needless to say, the best way to stop most animal abuse from
happening is to end animal agriculture altogether.</p>
