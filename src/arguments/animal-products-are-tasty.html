title: "Animal products are tasty"
---

<h2>Animal products are tasty</h2><p>Animal products are a result of the suffering and killing of animals. If we can justify eating animals and their secretions by merely saying that we like the taste, this implies we believe that unethical actions can be justified by the personal pleasure we derive from them. This is clearly problematic. Using this line of thinking, we could justify stealing, for example, because it feels good to have more money. Harming another sentient being for our own pleasure is immoral.</p><p><a href="/">‚Üê Return to all arguments</a></p>
