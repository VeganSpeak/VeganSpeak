<p>Our ancestors did many things that we’d find disturbing, including <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32890697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killing each other</a>, and don’t do many things we do today that improve our lives. Basing our ethics on cavemen is not going to take us very far. Our knowledge has improved, and our ethical behaviour should improve accordingly.</p>
