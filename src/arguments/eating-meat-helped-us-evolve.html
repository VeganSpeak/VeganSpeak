<p>It doesn’t matter if it did, because we live in a very different
world and different things today will make us evolve other than eating
meat. Also, that something helped us evolve doesn’t mean that such
behaviour is ethical or acceptable today. Early homo sapiens used rape
as a strategy for gene-promotion when they could not get access to
consensual sex. This helped the human species evolve to where we are
today, we cannot then say that sexual violence is in any way acceptable.</p><p>In addition, most scientists agree that <em>it wasn’t meat</em>, but <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?no-ist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking foods, that made our brains evolve</a>.
This would explain why we’re the smartest animals and the only animals
that cook, while other more carnivorous animals like cats are less
intelligent than us. The hypothesis is that cooking allowed humans to
get more energy from the same volume of food, and to spend less time
chewing, which meant this extra energy helped fuel brain growth.</p>
