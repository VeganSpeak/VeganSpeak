<p>Veganism <em>can be</em> expensive, but it is by no means a
necessity. As with any eating pattern, a vegan diet can be as expensive
or as cheap as we want it to be. Generally, however, a plant-based diet
is substantially cheaper than most diets out there, given that the
staple foods in a vegan diet (and coincidentally also staples in
impoverished societies) are things like rice, beans, lentils, potatoes,
bread, tofu and so forth. For most of the world, meat is a luxury,
expensive item. Itâ€™s only cheap in developed countries because the
government subsidises the industry.</p>
