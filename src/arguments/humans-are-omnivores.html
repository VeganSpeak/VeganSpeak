title: "Humans are omnivores"
---

<h2>Humans are omnivores</h2><p>This is still debated in the scientific community. There’s a
substantial amount of evidence pointing towards us being herbivores, or
at least scavengers (like rats, who eat meat after the animal’s been
killed by other predators). This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1312295/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article by William C. Roberts, MD</a> argues that humans must be plant eaters
because only herbivores develop atherosclerosis (hardening of the
arteries). Technically though, we’re omnivores by definition just
because we can digest meat. But this is irrelevant because we can be
completely healthy as vegans, and eating meat causes harm to animals.</p><p>Having the ability to do something doesn’t mean it’s right to
do so. Human beings can carry out many atrocities, and some do, but
those that do face punishment because their actions are wrong. Having
canine teeth or the ability to digest meat doesn’t justify eating
animals in the same way having a fist doesn’t justify beating someone
up.</p><h3>More on this topic:</h3><div class="youtube-player" data-id="Hq23d8aI5LE"></div><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
