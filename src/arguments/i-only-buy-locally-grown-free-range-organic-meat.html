<p>In all farms, regardless of how the lives of animals are before slaughter, animals die at a fraction of their lifespan. Farmed animals get killed as soon as their purpose is served, or as soon as they reach a profitable size. The definition of grass-fed, organic and free-range animals is very loose and can vary wildly. It doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that the animals have any quality of life, it just means the farm has to meet some arbitrary requirements to earn that title.</p>
