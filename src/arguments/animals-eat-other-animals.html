title: "Animals eat other animals"

<h2>Animals eat other animals</h2><p>We should not base our ethics as a society on what animals do in
nature. Lions eat their offsprings if they don’t have enough food,
engage in violent territorial disputes and forcibly impregnate females.
Dogs smell each others’ backside when they first meet. Many animals even
kill <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/do-animals-murder-their-own-species" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">members of their own species</a>.
If we say that animal behaviour is a basis for human morality, we could
advocate murder, infanticide, rape and several other unethical and/or
disgusting behaviour that are commonplace in nature.</p><p>Another crucial point is that animals in the wild kill to
survive. We don’t need to eat other animals to survive, and doing so
causes suffering, so if we can avoid it, we should. Animals are clearly
not good ethical role models.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
