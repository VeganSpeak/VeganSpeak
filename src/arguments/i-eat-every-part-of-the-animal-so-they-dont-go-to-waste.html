title: "I eat every part of the animal so they don’t go to waste"

<h2>I eat every part of the animal so they don’t go to waste</h2><p>Animals don’t care what we do with their bodies after their death, they care about staying alive. If we’ve already committed the unethical, unnecessary action of killing an animal, what we do after doesn’t make it any better. By this logic, American cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer should have received a shorter sentence, because he used nearly every part of his victims’ bodies. He ate various parts of them and even turned some body parts into household items.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
