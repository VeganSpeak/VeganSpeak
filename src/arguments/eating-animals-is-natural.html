<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s natural, because this doesn’t imply eating meat is ethical or good. This is known as an “<a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeal to nature fallacy</a>”. We don’t do things solely because they’re natural. We use
planes, cars, buildings, clothing, cutlery, cups, glasses, and an array
of things that are not natural. There are other natural things we avoid,
such as killing members of our own species and forcibly impregnating
females, because nature is a violent place. Some diseases and health
problems are natural, but we do whatever we can to get cured.</p><p>Our civilisation is largely focused on reducing suffering
rather than in staying aligned with nature. In many cases, we strive to
avoid the dangers of nature. We should do what’s ethical, not what’s
natural. Killing animals when we don’t need to is unethical, period.</p>
