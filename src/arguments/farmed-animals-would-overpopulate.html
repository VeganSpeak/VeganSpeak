<h2>Farmed animals would overpopulate</h2><p>The animals we eat, wear and experiment on have been artificially bred to meet the demand for animal products. If the demand decreases, the number of animals brought into existence will decrease too. There was no problem with overpopulation of cows, chickens and pigs before humans started messing with their bodies. If we stop breeding them out of control, they wouldn’t overpopulate.</p><h3>More on this topic:</h3><div class="youtube-player" data-id="1M1fKxjlLV4"></div><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
