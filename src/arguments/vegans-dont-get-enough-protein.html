<p>Protein is an incredibly bio-available nutrient. We can get all the
protein we want from plant sources without the potential health risks of
eating meat, dairy and eggs (some forms of cancer, diabetes, high blood
pressure, coronary heart disease, strokes, etc). The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest study ever done</a> on vegan nutrient profiles show vegans on average get <strong>almost the same amount of protein</strong> as non-vegans without supplementation (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/figure/F1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see Figure 1</a>).
This is because all whole plant foods contain some protein and when we
eat enough calories of a variety of these we can easily meet all our
protein needs. Protein deficiency is only really seen in people with
chronic under-eating. Even then, it is more likely that someone dies of
fat deficiency than protein deficiency in a state of starvation.</p><p>If we were to eat 2000 calories of pure white rice, for instance, we’d get <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/4766327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">41 grams of protein</a>.
This is already the recommended daily intake for sedentary women that
eat 2000 calories per day. And rice is considered to be a low protein
food, so if we add vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta and tofu,
we’re going to get more than enough. Even in the extremely rare case
that someone wants to get an amount of protein that is not achievable
eating solely plants (which is probably not healthy anyway), plenty of
affordable vegan protein powders are available worldwide.</p><p>Further reading: <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/how-do-vegans-get-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Protein Isn’t a Problem for Vegans By Matthew Chalmers</a>.</p>
