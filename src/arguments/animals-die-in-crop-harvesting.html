title: "Animals die in crops harvested for vegan food"

<h2>Animals die in crops harvested for vegan food</h2><p>This is true, accidental deaths in crop harvesting are a fact of our current existence, <a href="../you-cant-be-100-vegan/">no vegan claims to be perfect</a>. Vegans
try to avoid animal harm through practical solutions such as not supporting industries that exploit animals, avoiding direct harm, making ethical choices where possible, etc.</p><p>However, an argument <em>against veganism</em> that uses this claim is in fact an argument several times stronger <em>in favour of veganism</em>.</p><p>At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost eight billion people</a> the consumption demands require by our global population is increased several times over by the need to feed <a href="https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">70 billion farmed animals</a>
per year than if we were focused on feeding only our own species.</p><blockquote>A vegan lifestyle rejects the exploitation and cruelty found in the meat, <a href="../the-dairy-industry-doesnt-harm-animals/">dairy</a> and <a href="../the-egg-industry-doesnt-harm-animals/">egg industries</a> and reduces the consumption demands required to feed ourselves.</blockquote><p>Some people may argue in favour of exclusively eating grass-fed animals
who do not require grain, soy or other mass produced feed, therefore not killing small animals in crop
harvests. Not only is this impractical and unsustainable on a large scale, it is inherently <em>elitist</em><em>.</em> There simply is not enough space available in the world to feed billions of people on grass fed animals.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
