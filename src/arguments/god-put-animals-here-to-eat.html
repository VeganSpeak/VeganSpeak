<p>No religion mandates eating. We don’t have to eat animals to be a devout Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, etc. Therefore,
we can be vegan <strong>and</strong> religious, just like we can recycle
and be religious, or just like any other modern lifestyle choice we
make which is not explicitly mentioned in religious texts but is also
not prohibited.</p><p>Plus, why would a wise and omniscient God give pain receptors
to animals and then tell us to kill them? Surely God would approve of us
being vegan, therefore causing the least amount of harm possible to
animals and the environment, both of which are God’s creations.</p><h3>More on this topic:</h3><div class="youtube-player" data-id="2-R1yJeFtHE"></div>
