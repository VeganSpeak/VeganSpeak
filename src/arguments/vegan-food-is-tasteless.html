title: "Vegan food is tasteless"

<p>Most of the food humans eat is already vegan. Fruits, vegetables,
grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta, bread, potatoes and soy, to name a
few things. We enjoy these foods every day and don’t think they’re
unpalatable. In fact, the main way we condiment our food to make it
delicious is by using salt, sugar, herbs and spices (all plants!). There
are award winning vegan food products and restaurants all over the
world. We can easily find online recipes to veganise all of our
favourite meals.</p><p>But even if vegan food <em>was</em> tasteless (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=incredible+vegan+food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s not</a>), morality trumps personal pleasure. <em>An animal’s desire to live will always be greater than our desire to eat a steak, and deep down we all know this.</em></p>
