<p>This is an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeal to popularity fallacy</a>” which holds no true logical value. Most people in the past thought slavery was acceptable and that women shouldn’t vote. Most people usually agree with a certain oppression and it is a small group of people that fight to change the status quo.</p>
