title: "You buy products from sweatshops"

<h2>You buy products from sweatshops</h2><p>Trying to invalidate veganism by saying vegans still cause harm by
buying from sweatshops is a form of the “al tu quoque” fallacy. The
truth of a statement or philosophy not determined by the individuals who
believe in it. If a murderer says it’s wrong to commit murder, that
doesn’t make murdering people right. If a vegan says it’s wrong to kill
animals for food, but causes some harm elsewhere, that doesn’t make
killing animals right. It is impossible to cause zero harm, and no vegan
claims perfection, but we’re trying to reduce our impact as far as
practicable and possible.</p><p>Plus, buying animal products is not helping workers in unfair
conditions. Being vegan and buying from sweatshops is better than not
being vegan and <em>still</em> buying from sweatshops. But what if we
saw the argument the other way round? In other words, that the logical
conclusion, if you’re against slave labour, is that you’re against all
oppression, including animal oppression.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
