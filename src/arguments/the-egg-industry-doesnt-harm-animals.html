<p>In the egg industry, only females are required since males cannot lay
eggs. So at the hatcheries, male and female chicks are separated as
they pass through a conveyor belt.</p><p>Males are considered useless so they are either killed at the
hatchery (either by being macerated alive, drowned or suffocated) or
thrown into the bin alive. Females are painfully de-beaked and sent off
to farms, where they will lay a painful 300+ eggs per year due to
genetic manipulation (as opposed to a wild chicken’s 20 or so per year).
This process happens on any farm, regardless of it being free-range,
organic or whatever.</p><p>After hens stop producing eggs at a profitable rate, they are
sent to slaughter, which involves being thrown into an electric bath to
be stunned, then hoisted up upside down and going along a conveyor belt
to have their throats slit. Many chickens will remain fully conscious
after their throats are slit and will be boiled alive in the
de-feathering tank afterwards. Their slaughter happens at around two
years of age. The natural lifespan of a chicken is eight years.</p>
