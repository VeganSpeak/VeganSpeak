title: "Morality is subjective"

<h2>Morality is subjective</h2><p>Advocates of subjective morality wouldn’t tolerate such subjectivity if <em>they</em>
were the victims. If someone kills a human, or an animal, and truly
believes there’s nothing wrong with this, subjective morality states
that this wouldn’t be unethical. Morality must be based on facts and
reason, it can’t be completely arbitrary, or else anyone can justify any
atrocity by stating that their morality is subjective. We must have at
least some objective measurement of what is and isn’t ethical. Agreeing
that killing beings for pleasure or convenience isn’t ethical is a good
place to start to prevent violence towards humans and animals. Veganism
follows from this.</p><p>Even if we believe morality is subjective, it’s likely that <em>most people would agree</em> that animals have some moral value and shouldn’t be harmed for no reason. So by this <em>subjective</em>
morality, we can agree that veganism is right because harming animals
unnecessarily (we don’t need to eat them to live healthily) is wrong.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
