<p>Historians are still unsure about this, and there is compelling
evidence to suggest he wasn’t a vegetarian. But it is actually
irrelevant if he was. Using this argument implies that everything that
Hitler did was wrong and we must do the opposite. But this isn’t a sound
argument. Hitler liked dogs, took showers, brushed his teeth, ate and
slept. Should we avoid doing these things because he did? Of course not!</p><p>In addition, why should we solely focus on Hitler when talking
about veganism? If we look at all dictators, murderers, serial killers,
rapists, and terrorists throughout history, the vast majority are
meat-eaters. So if we’re going with the argument that the diets of
criminals should be avoided, why are we eating meat?</p>
