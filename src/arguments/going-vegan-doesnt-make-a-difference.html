<h2>Going vegan doesn’t make a difference</h2><p>Veganism is both a matter of principle and a practical solution to animal abuse. If we’re against paying others to torture and kill animals, then we shouldn’t do it, regardless of whether we will actually change something. However, being vegan also has real effects because of supply and demand. If someone buys vegan alternatives to meat products, every day, three times a day, for a year, they would’ve reduced the thousands of millions of vegans in the world, this represents a serious drop in demand. The UK has seen a <a href="https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/5-surprising-studies-that-prove-veganism-is-growing-around-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">360% increase in vegans in the last 10 years</a>, and other indicators also show veganism is on the rise.
