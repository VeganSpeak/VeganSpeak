<h2>Farmers treat their animals like family</h2><p>No doubt many farmers feel some form of attachment to the sentient beings they raise and care for, these people would have to be especially callous to feel nothing at all—though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIWfZCiWsNU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it does happen</a>. However, this is not the same kind of love or care that any normal person would feel towards their family members.</p><p>Famers care for their animals like one may care for a car, a computer or any other valuable business asset. Farmed animals exist to serve a business, once they no longer serve their purpose they are sold, slaughtered or disposed of. <br /></p><p>Male dairy cows are slaughtered hours after birth or sold for export and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/26/dairy-dirty-secret-its-still-cheaper-to-kill-male-calves-than-to-rear-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slaughtered for veal</a>. Male chicks produced for the egg industry are separated at birth and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9jV-SW5bo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffocated to death</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udSiluTAOaQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shredded alive</a>. As we all know, lambs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO6Wd1i7eoM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent to slaughter while they are still babies</a>, with the unluckiest sent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr5oyFSrZ9I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-stun slaughterhouses</a>. Pigs are suffocated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajWrCfqlbo8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gas chambers</a> before having their throats cut, while little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoZ1_ZcpeLI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pigglets have their tails docked and teeth clipped</a> without anaesthetic. Examples of the pain, suffering and torture we subject innocent sentient animals to are endless. <br /></p><p>Is this how farmers treat their family?<br /></p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
