Animal deaths in crop harvesting are a fact of our current *non-vegan farming practices*, The aim of veganism is to avoid animal harm through practical solutions such as not supporting industries that exploit animals, avoiding direct harm, and making ethical choices where practicable. The [assumption that vegans can or must be perfect](../you-cant-be-100-vegan/) is not a vegan one.

The argument that animals die in crop harvesting is in fact a stronger argument in favor of veganism, as the consumption demands required to feed billions of farmed animals increase the need for crop harvesting and thus animal deaths.

Eating only grass-fed animals is impractical and unsustainable on a large scale and is inherently elitist, as it is not affordable or feasible for the majority of the global population.
