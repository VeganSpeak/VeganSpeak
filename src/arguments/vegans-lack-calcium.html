title: "Vegans lack calcium"

<p>Calcium is in no way exclusive to animal products. There are entire
cultures who’ve never consumed cow’s milk that don’t have a higher
incidence of osteoporosis than the developed world. Producing cow’s milk
required humans to learn how to domesticate animals, which was achieved
relatively recently in human history. So it is illogical to think that
humans evolved to require nutrition from a fluid that they could not get
in nature until centuries later.</p><p>Humans are mammals. Like all mammals, we consume milk during
infancy, and after the weaning process, adults do not require their
mother’s milk. If we really needed milk afterwards, wouldn’t it make
more biological sense to continue drinking milk designed for our own
species? If that sounds strange, consider that we’re drinking milk from
someone else’s mother, and not even from our own species.</p><p>Good vegan sources of calcium include dried herbs, sesame
seeds, figs, tofu, almonds, flax seeds, Brazil nuts and kale. Most vegan
milks are fortified with calcium, so we could just consume those as we
would do any cow milk.</p>
