title: "Human rights are more important"
---

<h2>Human rights are more important</h2><p>Veganism is a non-action. We don’t need to actively do anything time
consuming to live vegan. Once you spend some time initially figuring out
what to buy at the grocery store and what’s suitable for vegans, most
people won’t spend additional time thinking about food than they did
before. As such, we can continue to fight for human rights or other
“more important” causes while eating a veggie burger or bean burrito
instead of a steak. We don’t need to harm animals while we fight against
human oppression.</p><p>It is also worth putting the animal suffering problem into perspective. Worldwide, <a href="https://www.animalequality.net/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 billion land animals</a> are killed every year for food. Animal agriculture is the <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon deforestation</a>.
Nowhere in the world are humans being exploited in the magnitude and
severity as non-human animals are. If they were, there would be global
unrest and the issue would be addressed immediately.</p><p>Also, in many cases, animal abuse can cause human suffering.
High meat and dairy diets are responsible for some of the United States’
leading killers, like heart disease and strokes. In areas where new
slaughterhouses are set up, the <a href="http://animalstudies.msu.edu/Slaughterhouses_and_Increased_Crime_Rates.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rates of domestic violence and crime increase</a>.
Many human rights violations occur in factory farms because of the high
production rate required to meet the demand for meat. For example, <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/No_Relief_Embargo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some US factory farm workers wear diapers to work due to a lack of bathroom breaks</a>.</p><p>Shouldn’t we think the animal rights issue is at least as
important as some human rights issues? And even if not, shouldn’t we be
vegan by default to avoid causing extra suffering while we focus on
solving human rights violations?</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
