title: "Humans are superior to animals"
---

<h2>Humans are superior to animals</h2><p>In some ways, yes we are superior in many aspects.</p><blockquote>I don't hold animals superior or even equal to humans. The whole case for behaving decently to animals rests on the fact that we are the superior species. We are the species uniquely capable of imagination, rationality and moral choice – and that is precisely why we are under the obligation to recognise and respect the rights of animals.<br /><br />— Brigid Brophy</blockquote><p>However, we’re not superior
in our ability to fly or see in the dark, to exist under water or to navigate naturally by magnetic fields. It could be argued that some
humans are superior to other humans in certain areas. Some humans are
smarter, faster, stronger, better looking and so on. By this logic, the
“superior” humans could in theory abuse the “inferior” ones.</p><p>Superiority doesn’t grant us a right to abuse other sentient
beings. In fact, this line of thinking is what justified many atrocities
in the past, like The Holocaust, black segregation, disenfranchisement
of women, and so on. Of course, nobody wants animals to have the same
rights as humans, like the right to vote, because this doesn’t make
sense. What does make sense, however, is to grant them the right to life
because their sentience means they have an interest to live, just like
us.</p><h3>More on this topic:</h3><div class="youtube-player" data-id="-6qhtS5moFM"></div><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
