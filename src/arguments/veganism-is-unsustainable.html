title: "Veganism is unsustainable"

<h2>Veganism is unsustainable</h2><p>Quite the opposite, actually. Eating meat is highly unsustainable. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nations</a>
has been urging us for years to move towards a plant-based diet because
“lesser consumption of animal products is necessary to save the world
from the worst impacts of climate change”. This is because <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animal
agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions, about
18%, than all the transport systems combined in the world, around 13%</a>. It is also the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones and several other environmental degradation indicators.</p><p>In fact, we could feed more people with less land, water and resource usage if everyone was vegan than if people ate meat. A <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornell University article</a>
states that the US alone could feed about 800 million more people “if
all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were
consumed directly by people”.</p><p>More information on this can be found at <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cowspiracy.com</a>.</p><p><a href="/">← Return to all arguments</a></p>
