title: "Farmed animals are bred to be killed"

<h2>Farmed animals are bred to be killed</h2><p>Bringing an animal into existence for the purpose of abusing, using
and harming them is not ethical under any circumstance. If we breed dogs
for dogfighting, the harm inflicted on the dogs by the fight is still
not morally acceptable. If we breed bulls for bullfighting, the
suffering inflicted on them is never justified.</p><p>The animals that are being used and killed do not care about
why they were bred, they just want to live and avoid suffering. It is
not our right to go against those interest just because we brought them
into existence.</p><h3>More on this topic:</h3><div class="youtube-player" data-id="_L84EXgRVhY"></div><p><a href="/">‚Üê Return to all arguments</a></p>
