<p>Our body produces vitamin D, a hormone, when exposed to sunlight. We need about 20 minutes of sunlight exposure per day to get our daily amount of vitamin D. Most people don’t get this, which is why the UK government recommends that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-36846894">everyone takes a vitamin D supplement</a>. This is because “limited amounts of the vitamin are found in foods such as oily fish, eggs and fortified cereals”.</p>
