<p>Cows in the dairy industry, arguably, live more miserable lives than
cows raised for meat. This is because they are exploited throughout
their lives for their milk and then killed.</p><p>Given that cows produce milk <strong>only when they’re pregnant</strong>,
the process begins with forced artificial insemination of cows. Farmers
insert their arms into the sexual orifice of cows and pump bull semen
into them. This is a necessary step for milk production and occurs in
small family farms all the way to factory farms.</p><p>Once the cow gives birth, two things may happen. If the baby is
male, he’s of no use for the farmers since he’ll never produce milk.
Therefore, the baby is either <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2152608/Baby-calves-shot-C4-documentary-People-right-complain-dont-inform-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed at the farm</a>,
or <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/what-is-veal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold to the veal industry</a> for meat. If the baby is female, then
she’ll endure the same future as her mother, going through several
cycles of emotional and physical abuse. In both cases, the calves get
taken away soon after birth, and mother cows tend to cry for days after
their baby is stolen.</p><p>After about two or three milking cycles, the cow’s milk
production rate becomes unprofitable, so the cow is killed. At this
stage, the cow is usually six years old. The natural lifespan of a cow
is around twenty years.</p><h3>Key takeaways</h3><ul><li>Dairy cows are forcibly impregnated and give birth for us to have milk.</li><li>Male calves are killed or sold for other uses—such as veal consumption—so we have milk.</li><li>Dairy cows are killed when their milk production no longer meets profitable requirements.</li><li>We can't have dairy products without the death and exploitation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cows+peacful+loving+animals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peaceful, loving animals</a>.</li></ul>
