<p>Yes, this is a sad reality. But as consumers, we aren’t responsible
for keeping all industries in business. When we go to the supermarket,
we don’t buy every single product they sell to make sure nobody goes out
of business. As consumers, we choose where our money goes and pay for
the products we want to see more of, and we don’t buy those we dislike.
We all understand this, which is why when someone quits smoking or
drinking alcohol, people don’t tell them they’re putting people in the
tobacco and alcohol industries out of jobs.</p><p>However, it is important to realise that jobs aren’t lost, only
displaced. If we’re not buying milk we’d be buying soy milk instead,
therefore creating jobs in the plant-based milk industry. While it is
true that dairy farmers will have a tough time, for example, it is also
true that there is a growing demand for other crops like rice, soy and
oats which is putting more people into jobs in those industries, which
is only for the best.</p>
