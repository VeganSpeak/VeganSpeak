<p>Eating animals is not necessary. There are millions of vegans across the globe and from all paths of life that lead perfectly healthy lives. In fact, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>, the United States’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Nutrition_and_Dietetics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest organisation of food and nutrition professionals</a>, states the following:</p><blockquote>“It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and
Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including <strong>vegan, diets
are healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits
for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.</strong> These diets are
appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy,
lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood and for
athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than
diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources
and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegetarians and
vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions, including
ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain types of
cancer, and obesity.”</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest study ever on vegan nutrient profiles</a> found:</p><blockquote>“In strict vegetarians, low dietary intakes of vitamin B12
and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids, in addition to iron and zinc,
have often been of concern <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25</a></sup>. In the present study, mean intakes of these nutrients were above minimum requirements <sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081456/#R26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">26</a></sup> in strict vegetarians.”</blockquote><p>In a modern environment where one is not living in a state of survival there is quite simply <a href="https://viva.org.uk/animals/number-animals-killed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no need to exploit and slaughter billions of sentient beings</a>. All necessary nutrients can be found in a healthy vegan diet.</p>
