<p>The definition of veganism is: <em>“Veganism is a way of living which
seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of
exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other
purpose”</em>.</p><p>It is not practicable and possible to die or get ill because we
don’t take medication we need. It is the law in the US, the UK and
Europe that all medicine must be tested on animals before being released
to the market, so vegans cannot practically avoid this since there
aren’t any non-tested medicines.</p><p>But this is a different situation to eating animal products for
pleasure and convenience when there are plenty of other options
available at the supermarket. We’re not putting our health at risk when
deciding to avoid animal products. Also, it is worth mentioning that
buying the medicine is not actually increasing demand for animal testing
since the medicine was tested before entering the market and never
again, whereas animal products require animal deaths every time.</p>
